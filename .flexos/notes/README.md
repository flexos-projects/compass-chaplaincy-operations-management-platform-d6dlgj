# Notes

Session-based scratchpad for working notes, decisions, and reference materials.

## Sessions

| Session | Date | Topic |
|---------|------|-------|
| 001-project-kickoff | 2026-02-09 | Initial import and project setup |

## How Notes Work

Each session gets a numbered folder containing:
- `note.md` — Session notes (append-only)
- `changelog.md` — Changes made during the session
- `files/` — Reference files and attachments
